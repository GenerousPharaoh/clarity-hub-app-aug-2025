# TinyMCE Resources

This directory contains TinyMCE resources that are used by the Rich Text Editor in the application.
These files are copied from node_modules/tinymce by the copy-tinymce.js script.

Do not edit these files directly as they will be overwritten when the script is run again.

## Configuration

The TinyMCE editor is configured in src/layouts/panels/CenterPanel.tsx.
