-- Cleanup schema conflicts and fix any remaining issues
-- This migration addresses potential conflicts from legacy versions and ensures proper routing

-- 1. Ensure all necessary columns exist on the notes table with correct references
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Check if user_id column exists on notes table, add if missing
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'notes' AND column_name = 'user_id'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE notes ADD COLUMN user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
    END IF;
    
    -- Check if created_by column exists on notes table, add if missing
    IF NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'notes' AND column_name = 'created_by'
    ) THEN
        ALTER TABLE notes ADD COLUMN created_by UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
    END IF;
    
    -- Check if project_id column exists and has proper constraint

            REFERENCES projects(id)
            ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- 2. Ensure all necessary columns exist on the files table 
DO $$
BEGIN

-- 3. Remove duplicate indexes (if any exist)
DO $$

END $$;

-- 4. Ensure storage bucket permissions are properly set up
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_storage_all" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_authenticated_users_all_storage_access" ON storage.objects;

-- Create a unified permissive policy for authenticated users (better than multiple conflicting policies)
CREATE POLICY "allow_authenticated_users_all_storage_access" 
    ON storage.objects FOR ALL TO authenticated 
    USING (true) 
    WITH CHECK (true);
    
-- 5. Fix RLS policies to avoid circular dependencies in checks
-- First, drop potentially problematic policies that might cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view files in their projects" ON files;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view files in projects they collaborate on" ON files;

-- Create simplified policies that don't rely on recursive checks
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own files" 
    ON files FOR SELECT 
    USING (uploaded_by_user_id = auth.uid());
    
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert files" 
    ON files FOR INSERT 
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- 6. Fix notes policies to match actual table schema
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view notes in their projects" ON notes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_notes" ON notes;

-- Create simplified policy for notes - fixed to use created_by instead of owner_id
CREATE POLICY "Notes access for users" 
    ON notes FOR ALL 
    USING (user_id = auth.uid() OR created_by = auth.uid());

-- 7. Ensure we have all necessary configuration for TinyMCE
-- No database changes needed for this, but added here for documentation 

-- 8. Ensure unique constraint for notes on project_id and user_id
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'notes' AND column_name = 'project_id'
    ) AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns
        WHERE table_name = 'notes' AND column_name = 'user_id'
    ) THEN
        -- Only add constraint if both columns exist
        IF NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints
            WHERE constraint_name = 'notes_project_user_unique'
            AND table_name = 'notes'
        ) THEN
            ALTER TABLE notes
            ADD CONSTRAINT notes_project_user_unique UNIQUE (project_id, user_id);
        END IF;
