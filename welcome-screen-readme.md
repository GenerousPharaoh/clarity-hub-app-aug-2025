# Welcome Screen Implementation

## Overview

The welcome screen implementation enhances the user experience by providing a clear, visually appealing full-width placeholder when no project is selected, completely hiding the center and right panels.

## Features

- **Detection of Project Selection State**: The app tracks when a project is selected using `hasSelectedProject` state derived from the existing `selectedProjectId` in the store.
- **Full-Width Welcome Screen**: When no project is selected, both center and right panels are completely hidden (width â†’ 0), and a full-width welcome screen fills the entire space to their right.
- **Left Panel Preservation**: The left panel remains at its last width (or default) to allow users to select projects.
- **Animated Transitions**: Panel transitions are animated with smooth fades and resizing (150ms ease-out timing).
- **Size Memory**: Panel sizes are stored before hiding and automatically restored when a project is selected.

## Implementation Details

### WelcomePlaceholder Component

- A prominent welcome screen that dynamically fills all available space:
  - App logo with blue circular background
  - Large, clear welcome title and instruction text
  - Multiple animated arrows pointing to the left panel for visual guidance
  - Subtle gradient background with decorative pattern

### ResizablePanels Component Enhancements

- **Advanced Panel Manipulation**:
  - Sets center and right panel width to 0 when no project is selected
  - Hides resize handles when welcome screen is active
  - Uses absolute positioning for the welcome component
  - Controls visibility, opacity and sizing with smooth transitions

- **Imperative Panel Control**:
  - Uses panel refs to control resize behavior programmatically
  - Implements delayed transitions for smoother animations
  - Prevents race conditions during panel state changes

### Transition States

1. **Initial/No Project State**:
   - Left panel visible at normal width
   - Center and right panels completely hidden (0% width)
   - Full-width welcome screen displayed
   - Resize handles hidden

2. **Project Selection State**:
   - Welcome screen fades out
   - Center and right panels restore to previous sizes
   - All resize handles become visible
   - Normal panel content renders

### Non-Breaking Integration

- The implementation preserves all existing data-fetching and editor logic
- No changes to API calls or Supabase queries
- TinyMCE initialization remains unchanged
- Uses existing app state (`selectedProjectId`) rather than introducing new state

## User Experience

When a user opens the application:

1. The left panel shows the list of projects
2. The center and right panels are completely hidden
3. A full-width welcome screen fills the space, with arrows pointing to project selection
4. When a user selects a project:
   - The welcome screen fades away
   - The center and right panels smoothly transition to their normal sizes
   - All panel content appears with proper animations
   - Resize handles become active for customization

This implementation creates a more focused, visually appealing initial experience while maintaining all existing functionality.
