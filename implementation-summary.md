## Remaining Work

1. **Fix Authentication Issues**
   - The "Skip Login (Demo Mode)" functionality needs to be fixed
   - Anonymous login is disabled but needs to be enabled or worked around

2. **Validate Storage Permissions**
   - The RLS policy fixes need to be validated with the Supabase instance
   - Ensure all buckets are created and accessible

3. **Test Project Creation**
   - Verify that projects can be created and displayed in the UI
   - Ensure project ownership is properly set

4. **Test File Uploads**
   - Confirm file uploads work end-to-end in the application
   - Test with various file types (PDF, images, etc.)

5. **UI Component Fixes**
   - Address any UI rendering issues
   - Fix overlapping elements
   - Ensure responsive design works correctly

## Next Steps

1. Run the SQL fix script with proper credentials:
   ```bash
   ./fix-supabase-with-cli.sh
   ```

2. Verify the storage permissions are correctly set in Supabase dashboard

3. Update the authentication flow to properly support demo mode:
   ```javascript
   // Fix in authentication component
   ```

4. Test the project creation flow:
   ```bash
   node fix-project-display.js
   ```

5. Test file uploads:
   ```bash
   node test-uploads.js
   ```

The fixes implemented should address the core issues with Supabase storage permissions and file uploads when applied correctly with the proper credentials and environment.
