// Manual test script for project creation and routing
// ---------------------------------------------------
// This script demonstrates the expected flow for creating a project 
// and verifying that routing works correctly after clicking "Create" button.

/**
 * Test Steps:
 * 
 * 1. Navigate to the app homepage at http://localhost:5173
 * 2. Click "Skip Login (Demo Mode)" to enter demo mode
 * 3. Verify the projects page loads
 * 4. Click the "New" button to open the create project dialog 
 * 5. Enter a project name in the input field
 * 6. Click the "Create" button
 * 7. Verify that the URL changes to include "/projects/{id}"
 * 8. Verify that the center panel becomes visible with the new project
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * 
 * - After clicking "Create", the app should immediately navigate to the new project page
 * - The URL should change to include the new project ID
 * - The center panel for the project should be visible
 * - The project name should appear in the UI
 */

// Implementation Notes:
// 
// 1. The LeftPanel.tsx component has been updated to include proper navigation:
//    - Added useNavigate hook import
//    - Added call to navigate(`/projects/${data.id}`) after successful project creation
//
// 2. Key elements now have data-test attributes for easier testing:
//    - data-test="new-project-button" - Button to open project dialog
//    - data-test="create-project-dialog" - Project creation dialog
//    - data-test="project-name-input" - Input field for project name
//    - data-test="create-project-button" - Button to create project
//    - data-test="center-panel" - Center panel that appears after project creation
//
// These changes ensure that after typing a project name and clicking Create,
// proper routing occurs and the user is taken to the new project view.
