# Fixes for React Infinite Loop Issues

The following changes were made to fix the infinite loop and maximum update depth issues:

1. Updated Zustand store usage
   - Replaced object destructuring with individual selectors
   - Added shallow comparison utilities
   - Created a helper function to simplify shallow comparison

2. Fixed InputBase components
   - Enhanced components with useCallback for event handlers
   - Made sure all handlers have proper dependency arrays
   - Improved component memoization

3. General code improvements
   - Better error handling
   - More consistent state updates
   - Optimized rendering in multiple components

These changes should resolve the issues with infinite loops and excessive re-renders.

# Bug Fix: filteredFiles.map is not a function

## Problem Summary

The application was experiencing a critical error: `Uncaught TypeError: filteredFiles.map is not a function` in the LeftPanel component. This occurred because:

1. The `filterFiles` function expected an array, but was sometimes receiving a non-array value
2. No type safety or array checking was implemented
3. State management was relying on direct API calls without proper error handling
4. File upload workflow had race conditions where files weren't immediately visible

## Solution Implemented

We implemented a comprehensive fix focusing on four key areas:

### 1. Type-Safe React Query Integration

- Added `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and state management
- Created a custom `useProjectFiles` hook that guarantees data is always an array
- Implemented a `useFileUpload` hook for safe and consistent file uploads
- Added TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety

### 2. Defensive Array Handling

- Added explicit checks to ensure `filteredFiles` is always an array:
```typescript
const filteredFiles = filterFiles(files || []);

// Plus this safety check in the filter function
if (!Array.isArray(filesToFilter)) {
  console.warn('filterFiles received non-array input:', filesToFilter);
  return [];
}
```

### 3. Unified Error Handling & UI Feedback

- Added proper error states in UI components 
- Implemented loading indicators
- Added error alerts with specific error messages
- Implemented consistent progress indicators for file uploads

### 4. Database & Storage Improvements

- Created a migration to ensure consistent storage policies
- Fixed CORS configuration for file uploads
- Created fallback policies to ensure authenticated users can always access their files
- Implemented proper SQL constraints and indexes

## Affected Files

- `src/hooks/useProjectFiles.ts` (new) - Custom React Query hooks
- `src/layouts/panels/LeftPanel.tsx` - Main component refactoring
- `src/services/supabaseClient.ts` - Type safety and error handling
- `src/types/supabase.ts` (new) - Database type definitions
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated interfaces
- `src/main.tsx` - Added React Query provider
- `src/components/dialogs/RenameFileDialog.tsx` - Refactored with React Query
- `supabase/migrations/20250505000000_fix_storage_policies.sql` - Storage policy fixes

## Testing

The solution has been thoroughly tested to ensure:
- Files can be uploaded without errors
- The file list always renders correctly
- File filtering works properly
- Renaming files works correctly
- UI provides appropriate feedback during all operations

## Conclusion

By implementing centralized hooks with React Query and ensuring proper type safety, we have eliminated the possibility of `filteredFiles.map is not a function` errors. The system now handles all edge cases gracefully and provides helpful error messages to users when issues occur.
