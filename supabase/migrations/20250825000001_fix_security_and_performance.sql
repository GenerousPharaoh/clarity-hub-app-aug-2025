-- CRITICAL SECURITY AND PERFORMANCE FIXES
-- 
-- SECURITY ISSUES FIXED:
-- 1. Overly permissive RLS policies allowing access to any project data
-- 2. Users can access projects they don't own or collaborate on
-- 
-- PERFORMANCE ISSUES FIXED:
-- 1. Missing database indexes causing slow queries
-- 2. N+1 query problems in document citations
-- 3. Inefficient project collaboration checks
--
-- This migration ensures:
-- - Users can only access their own projects and projects they collaborate on
-- - Demo mode continues to work without database writes
-- - Proper indexing for fast queries
-- - Optimized views to prevent N+1 queries

-- Step 1: Drop all existing overly permissive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_files" ON files;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_projects" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_projects_users" ON projects_users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_all_notes" ON notes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "auth insert" ON projects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "auth insert" ON files;
